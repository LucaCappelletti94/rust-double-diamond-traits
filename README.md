# Rust double diamond trait error

Repository to study and reference the use of the error raised when using a double diamond trait dependency.

You can find a [Rust playground with the code to reproduce this issue here](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=7050b0182982e8cd05d4089a4b7475fe).

## The error

The double diamond trait error appears whenever a trait dependency pattern analogous to the one illustrated
in the figure below is used. More specifically, whenever a child trait with associated types has to bind the
associated types of the parents to its own.

In code, this looks like:

```rust
pub trait Ancestor {
    type A;
}

pub trait Red: Ancestor<A = <Self as Red>::R> {
    type R;
}

pub trait Blue: Ancestor<A = <Self as Blue>::B> {
    type B;
}

pub trait Green: Ancestor<A = <Self as Green>::G> {
    type G;
}

pub trait RedGreen: Red<R = <Self as RedGreen>::RG> + Blue<B = <Self as RedGreen>::RG> {
    type RG;
}

pub trait GreenBlue: Red<R = <Self as GreenBlue>::GB> + Green<G = <Self as GreenBlue>::GB> {
    type GB;
}

pub trait RedGreenBlue:
    RedGreen<RG = <Self as RedGreenBlue>::RGB> + GreenBlue<GB = <Self as RedGreenBlue>::RGB>
{
    type RGB;
}
```

you can execute this code by runningÂ `cargo test` in this repository, and it will yield the following error:

```rust

```

I welcome any suggestions on how to solve this problem. It seems, at least to the humble opinion of my colleagues
and myself, a potential limitation of the current Rust type system. What do you think?
